## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

> Track new scientific researches of your interest by just forking (and staring) this repo!😊

*Zotero-arXiv-Daily* finds arxiv papers that may attract you based on the context of your Zotero library, and then sends the result to your mailbox📮. It can be deployed as Github Action Workflow with **zero cost**, **no installation**, and **few configuration** of Github Action environment variables for daily **automatic** delivery.

## ✨ Features
- Totally free! All the calculation can be done in the Github Action runner locally within its quota (for public repo).
- AI-generated TL;DR for you to quickly pick up target papers.
- Affiliations of the paper are resolved and presented.
- Links of PDF and code implementation (if any) presented in the e-mail.
- List of papers sorted by relevance with your recent research interest.
- Fast deployment via fork this repo and set environment variables in the Github Action Page.
- Support LLM API for generating TL;DR of papers.
- Ignore unwanted Zotero papers using a list of glob patterns.
- Support multiple sources of papers to retrieve:
  - arxiv
  - biorxiv
  - medrxiv

## 🚀 Usage
### Quick Start
1. Fork (and star😘) this repo.
![fork](./assets/fork.png)

2. Set Github Action environment variables.
![secrets](./assets/secrets.png)

Below are all the secrets you need to set. They are invisible to anyone including you once they are set, for security.

| Key |Description | Example |
| :---  | :---  | :--- |
| ZOTERO_ID  | User ID of your Zotero account. **User ID is not your username, but a sequence of numbers**Get your ID from [here](https://www.zotero.org/settings/security). You can find it at the position shown in this [screenshot](https://github.com/TideDra/zotero-arxiv-daily/blob/main/assets/userid.png). | 12345678  |
| ZOTERO_KEY | An Zotero API key with read access. Get a key from [here](https://www.zotero.org/settings/security).  | AB5tZ877P2j7Sm2Mragq041H   |
| SENDER | The email account of the SMTP server that sends you email. | abc@qq.com |
| SENDER_PASSWORD | The password of the sender account. Note that it's not necessarily the password for logging in the e-mail client, but the authentication code for SMTP service. Ask your email provider for this.   | abcdefghijklmn |
| RECEIVER | The e-mail address that receives the paper list. | abc@outlook.com |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | API Key when using the API to access LLMs. You can get FREE API for using advanced open source LLMs in [SiliconFlow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/b3XhBRAm). | sk-xxx |
| OPENAI_API_BASE | API URL when using the API to access LLMs. | https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1 |

Then you should also set a public variable `CUSTOM_CONFIG` for your custom configuration.
![vars](./assets/repo_var.png)
![custom_config](./assets/config_var.png)
Paste the following content into the value of `CUSTOM_CONFIG` variable:

  include_path: null # Or e.g. ["2026/survey/**", "2026/reading-group/**"]
  corpus_cache_path: data/zotero_corpus.json # Reuse this saved Zotero snapshot when it exists.
  refresh_corpus_cache: false # Set true once to re-fetch Zotero and overwrite the snapshot.

  reranker: local # The reranker to use. Example: 'local' or 'api'
```

That's all! Now you can test the workflow by manually triggering it:
![test](./assets/test.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The Test-Workflow Action is the debug version of the main workflow (Send-emails-daily), which retrieves up to 100 papers from the configured previous-day arXiv query. The main workflow will be automatically triggered every day and retrieve papers submitted on the previous UTC day. There is no new arxiv paper at weekends and holidays, in which case you may see "No new papers found" in the log of main workflow.

Then check the log and the receiver email after it finishes.

By default, the main workflow runs on 22:00 UTC everyday. You can change this time by editting the workflow config `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

### Local Running
Supported by [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), this workflow can easily run on your local device if uv is installed:
```bash
# set all the environment variables
# export ZOTERO_ID=xxxx
# ...
cd zotero-arxiv-daily
uv run main.py
```

## 📖 How it works
*Zotero-arXiv-Daily* first loads `data/zotero_corpus.json` when that saved Zotero snapshot exists; otherwise it retrieves the papers in your Zotero library once and saves that snapshot for later runs. It then retrieves papers submitted to arXiv on the previous UTC day, calculates abstract embeddings, and ranks candidates by weighted similarity to your Zotero papers (newer Zotero papers have higher weight). The TLDR of each paper is generated by LLM, given the text extracted by pymupdf4llm.

## 📌 Limitations
- The recommendation algorithm is very simple, it may not accurately reflect your interest. Welcome better ideas for improving the algorithm!
- High `MAX_PAPER_NUM` can lead the execution time exceed the limitation of Github Action runner (6h per execution for public repo, and 2000 mins per month for private repo). Commonly, the quota given to public repo is definitely enough for individual use. If you have special requirements, you can deploy the workflow in your own server, or use a self-hosted Github Action runner, or pay for the exceeded execution time.
